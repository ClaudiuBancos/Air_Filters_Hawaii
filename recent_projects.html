					<h1>Recent Projects</h1>

					<p>The Kau Hospital on the Big Island hired Air Filters Hawaii to evaluate their facility and we installed IQAir Chemisorber filters in their operating rooms, waiting room, cafeteria and office areas.</p>

					<p>Air Filters Hawaii has begun work on the Cone residence in Kihei which will be the first whole house vog free home utilizing whole house HVAC systems with Perfect 16 Multigas filters and HealthPro Plus filters.</p>

					<p>The Reipurth residence in Hilo was gutted for moister and mold problems associated with its oceanfront location. It is being renovated to protect the home from oceanfront moisture using dehumidification and air purification. Air Filters Hawaii provided the interior air quality consultation for the project and provided air filters for the entire residence.</p>
