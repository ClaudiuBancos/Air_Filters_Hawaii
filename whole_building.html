					<h2>CleanZone Series</h2>
					<img src="images/products/cleanzoneseries.jpg" alt="CleanZoneSeries">
					<p>The IQAir CleanZone is a modular ultra-high efficiency air purification system that was developed for indoor environments that require the highest level of air quality possible. The CleanZone systems can be ducted as a stand-alone system or into existing forced air heating, ventilation or air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The CleanZone is designed to purify up to 1200 cfm of air passing through a duct system with an efficiency of over 99.97% at 0.3 microns (size of bacteria) and over 99.5% at 0.003 microns (smaller than viruses). As a result, CleanZone systems are capable of retaining 10 times more particles than the highest MERV rated filter systems on the market. Thanks to sophisticated digital fan technology, the CleanZone eliminates the pressure drop that is typically associated with high-efficiency whole-house air cleaners. An intelligent filter life monitor tracks the life of every filter based on actual system usage. The CleanZone’s extremely large filters allow for the longest filter life in the industry. The MERV 16 pre-filter typically lasts for three years. The life of the HyperHEPA filter is typically six years. CleanZone systems require professional installation through a licenced HVAC contractor.</p>
